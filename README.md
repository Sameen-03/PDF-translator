#  PDF Translator with Local LLM (Ollama + Marker + MarkdownPDF)

This project provides a complete pipeline for translating PDF documents into other languages using a **local Large Language Model (LLM)**. It extracts structured text and images from a PDF, translates the text into the target language using Ollama, and regenerates a new translated PDF — all while preserving layout and formatting.
